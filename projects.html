            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>
              I am tasked for a group project to find a potential client that have designs problems and in need of a solution which spans for the whole term as the purpose of the course assignments. And the final assignment is the process of ideating, working together with the clients, to find a solution for their problems along the whole term and create a final solution concept for them to implement.

            <h3>1st Project</h3>
            <h4>Problem Found</h4>
            <p>
              After extensive research done with my team about our client and regarding what work they do, we found several problems, but I found a problem that is quite fatal that is with their paperwork for taking notes of their tasks which is essential for their kind of work. As they need to send these paperwork for their clients, writing it on paper is not efficient and effective, as from our research it was also not designed properly from the feedback of the workers. My team agreed on the problem that I have found regarding this.

            <h3>1st Project</h3>
            <h4>Solution Proposed</h4>
            <p>
              Therefore, I provided a solution to their design problem. That is by creating a digital solution towards their old-fashioned taking notes of their paperwork that is essential for their work. With the help of this digital solution concept, they will be able to implement this to their work and be efficient and effective at taking notes digitally and able to send directly to the clients while being paperless. They will also save a lot of money in the long run, as they will cut costs for their paper orders.

            <h3>1st Project</h3>
            <h4>Not Good Enough, Needed More Research</h4>
            <p>
              However, my initial design of the digital solution for the client was not good enough for the final submission concept idea to submit to the clients as the teaching team, the client and their workers was not satisfied with it. Therefore, this initial submission was essential to keep on working it towards the final submission to provide an exceptional digital solution for the client. My team was tasked to create a participatory workshop, where we planned to conduct a workbook to refine our concept idea and find results what designs the users preferred. And I was responsible of handing out the workbooks to the client and their workers.

            <h4>Final Concept</h4>
            <p>
              And after conducting the participatory workshop, we start to understand what designs the clients and their workers preferred. And from there we refined our concept idea where we still stick to our initial digital solution that is to create a digital paperwork to make their paperwork efficient and effective. But we reworked the designs based on the clients and their workers preference. I was responsible for creating the main layout designs and implementing the feedback we received through the participatory workshop.

          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>
            I am tasked with finalizing a UI design project, which is the result of extensive user research and iterative prototyping. This phase calls for me to create a refined, interactive prototype that embodies all the key features and navigational paths essential to my app, ensuring that it aligns with user needs and preferences.

          <h3>2nd Project</h3>
          <h4>Initial Step</h4>
          <p>
            Before I can create a final prototype for the final submission of my IAT334 course assignment, the Instructor pointed out that my team and I need to create several idea proposals to be submitted and be reviewed by the Instructor and TA. And after being reviewed, my app UI design idea was the one that got approved to be developed and create an initial prototype mockup to be then reviewed again by them before finalizing the prototype.

            I was responsible as the main person for creating the overall design of the app’s UI that includes several states to create the main navigations to be able to create a prototype for the final submission of my assignment. Since it is a financial app that is catered towards seniors aged above 65, I need to make sure that the UI design layout is easy and straightforward to use along with the usage of appropriate font sizes for seniors.

            I was also responsible as the main person for creating the overall prototype of the app’s UI that utilizes the different states that I made through Figma to create the main navigation of the app, and through Protopie, I was able to continue and develop my app UI design  into reality by creating a mockup of the prototype on how it will look like in real life. I was able to create a prototype that allows users to create an account, input their finances such as income and expense. All the states were properly connected with each other and able to keep memory of what the user had input in the app prototype.
