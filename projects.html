            <h3>1st Project</h3>
            <h4>Initial Step</h4>
            <p>
              Our project involved collaborating with a marine surveying company to overhaul their employee website, transitioning away from SharePoint. The objective was to design a user-friendly, standalone website that catered specifically to their operational needs and enhanced employee engagement.
              Our approach was grounded in design thinking, starting with a critical analysis of the existing SharePoint site and direct feedback from employees. By adopting tools like Adobe XD, we iterated on various design concepts, focusing on intuitive navigation and accessibility to accommodate all employees, including seniors. The process was highly collaborative, with team members specializing in different areas from research to design execution.
              Our primary challenge lay in crafting a UI/UX design that was senior-friendly. To tackle this, we immersed ourselves in inclusive design principles from our coursework and sought constructive feedback from instructors and TAs. Their insights were pivotal in refining our design, ultimately guiding us to a concept that met our criteria for accessibility and user engagement.
              The effectiveness of our project was demonstrated by the client's satisfaction with the final design, noting its potential to significantly enhance employee interaction with the website. Through this endeavor, we learned the critical role of inclusive design and the iterative nature of feedback in achieving a balance between aesthetics and functionality. This experience has equipped us with valuable insights into addressing diverse user needs and expectations in future projects.

          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>
            I am tasked with finalizing a UI design project, which is the result of extensive user research and iterative prototyping. This phase calls for me to create a refined, interactive prototype that embodies all the key features and navigational paths essential to my app, ensuring that it aligns with user needs and preferences.

          <h3>2nd Project</h3>
          <h4>Initial Step</h4>
          <p>
            Before I can create a final prototype for the final submission of my IAT334 course assignment, the Instructor pointed out that my team and I need to create several idea proposals to be submitted and be reviewed by the Instructor and TA. And after being reviewed, my app UI design idea was the one that got approved to be developed and create an initial prototype mockup to be then reviewed again by them before finalizing the prototype.

          <h4>Mockups</h4>
          <p>
            I was responsible as the main person for creating the overall design of the app’s UI that includes several states to create the main navigations to be able to create a prototype for the final submission of my assignment. Since it is a financial app that is catered towards seniors aged above 65, I need to make sure that the UI design layout is easy and straightforward to use along with the usage of appropriate font sizes for seniors.

            I was also responsible as the main person for creating the overall prototype of the app’s UI that utilizes the different states that I made through Figma to create the main navigation of the app, and through Protopie, I was able to continue and develop my app UI design  into reality by creating a mockup of the prototype on how it will look like in real life. I was able to create a prototype that allows users to create an account, input their finances such as income and expense. All the states were properly connected with each other and able to keep memory of what the user had input in the app prototype.
