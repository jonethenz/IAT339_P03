            <h3>1st Project</h3>
            <p>
              Our project involved collaborating with a marine surveying company to overhaul their employee website, transitioning away from SharePoint. The objective was to design a user-friendly, standalone website that catered specifically to their operational needs and enhanced employee engagement.
              Our approach was grounded in design thinking, starting with a critical analysis of the existing SharePoint site and direct feedback from employees. By adopting tools like Adobe XD, we iterated on various design concepts, focusing on intuitive navigation and accessibility to accommodate all employees, including seniors. The process was highly collaborative, with team members specializing in different areas from research to design execution.
              Our primary challenge lay in crafting a UI/UX design that was senior-friendly. To tackle this, we immersed ourselves in inclusive design principles from our coursework and sought constructive feedback from instructors and TAs. Their insights were pivotal in refining our design, ultimately guiding us to a concept that met our criteria for accessibility and user engagement.
              The effectiveness of our project was demonstrated by the client's satisfaction with the final design, noting its potential to significantly enhance employee interaction with the website. Through this endeavor, we learned the critical role of inclusive design and the iterative nature of feedback in achieving a balance between aesthetics and functionality. This experience has equipped us with valuable insights into addressing diverse user needs and expectations in future projects.

          <h3>2nd Project</h3>
          <p>
            This project involved creating a prototype for a financial management app specifically designed for seniors aged 65 and above. The app's primary function is to help users track their expenses and income, supporting them in managing their finances more effectively. Our team chose ProtoPie for prototyping due to its interactive capabilities.
            We initiated the project by identifying the unique needs of our target user base seniors. Understanding that this demographic often faces challenges with vision and technology use, we focused on developing a UI/UX that would be both accessible and easy to navigate. The design process included rigorous brainstorming, employing best practices from course readings on accessibility, and iterative testing with ProtoPie.
            The project presented two main challenges: designing a user-friendly interface for seniors, who may have limited tech experience and visual impairments, and addressing ProtoPie's limitations in performing mathematical calculations, which are crucial for the app's functionality.
            To make the app accessible to seniors, we implemented UI/UX features such as larger text sizes, high-contrast color schemes, and simplified navigation. To overcome ProtoPie's computational limitations, we innovated a workaround by using multiple states to simulate the appearance of complex calculations. This approach allowed us to demonstrate how inputs from users (e.g., expenses and income) would dynamically affect their financial overview without requiring real-time computation within the prototype.
            The final prototype was a testament to our ability to adapt design and prototyping tools to meet specific user needs. It showcased a balance between aesthetic appeal and functionality, tailored to the senior demographic. The innovative solution to ProtoPie's limitations ensured that the app's core purpose-financial tracking-was clearly and effectively demonstrated.
